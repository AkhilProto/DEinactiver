# DEinactiver
This is a Public Repository for Disabling Inactivity for your device(PC or Laptop) . You can do that in the settings also, but if you are someone who leaves their device at random and long times and want it to go to sleep mode immediately, you wouldn't be able to disable inactivity. And here is where DEInactiver comes in handy.
